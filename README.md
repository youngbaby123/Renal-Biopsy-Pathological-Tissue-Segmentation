Renal Biopsy Pathological Tissue Segmentation: A Comprehensive Review and Experimental Analysis

All samples used in this study were provided by The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chi￾nese Medical University (Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine) after de-identification (without patient information), and approval of Research Ethics Committee of the Zhejiang Provin￾cial Hospital of Chinese Medicine (Acceptance number 2024-KL-01). Meanwhile, all biopsy samples were processed following standard light and electron microscope techniques. Under the light microscope, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues were cut into slices (2 mm) and stained with one of the following methods: H&E, PAS, PASM, or Masson staining. 1340samples were obtained in total, including 339 samples with H&E staining, 356 samples with PAS staining, and 329 samples with PASM staining. Based on the above samples, this paper further constructed tiny datasets to accelerate the experimental verification, including a training dataset of 100 samples (25 for each staining) and a test dataset of 48 samples (12 for each staining). The complete datasets were called full datasets.
